# Minecraft 1.0 Dark GUI

As inspired by [Default Dark Mode](https://github.com/nebuIr/Default-Dark-Mode), this is the exact same thing as that, but this time for Minecraft 1.0 and compatible versions, oh jeez.

If you're more familiar with modding for newer versions of Minecraft, you might know that you can just drag and drop a folder in `resourcepacks` without it being ZIP'ed, but you might not know **for older versions of Minecraft, texture packs need to be ZIP'ed**, so simply download this git and place it in `minecraft/texturepacks`, making sure it is still a ZIP, if not, then it won't show up on the texture pack list at all.

This is a bit of a small README, isn't it? I guess I should have started off this by saying rubbish like how it makes the game «look as stunning as it did back in 2011, only now with a modern twist», or something like that.

_As made by Cass Python, «Minecraft 1.0 Dark GUI» brings back the fun and excitement of Markus Persson's Minecraft into the 21st century. Enjoy the comfort of this stunning texture pack that is compact and fun, all at the same time. - Minecraft 1.0 Dark GUI, a theme for all._

See? I can write pretentious text. Oh hey, if you want to, feel free to hire me on your next game, I'll make a banger README, that's for sure (my rates are too high).

All of the PNGs for this texture pack have been optimized, file-sizewise.

For older versions of the game, it is seemingly not possible for someone to use more than one texture pack at a time, so if you want to use this in conjunction with a mod that you like to use, you will need to make a new folder and copy and paste the files for this pack and any other texture packs into it, then making it a ZIP.
